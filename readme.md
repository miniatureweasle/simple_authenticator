# Plug & Play Authenticator

A simple user authentication system built with Python 3's Standard Library.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have python 3.6+ installed

```
python --version
```
You should get some output like 3.6.2. If you do not have Python, please install the latest 3.x version from python.org or refer to the Installing Python section of The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Python.

### Installing & Running

If you have Python 3 you are ready to go
```
cd simple_authenticator
python3 client.py signup
python3 client.py login
```

## Running the tests

I've included some rudimentary unit tests.
These could definitely be extended in the future.

```
python3 test.py
```
